      <h2>Jollof Rice</h2>
      <p>
        Jollof rice is a classic West African rice dish, known for its vibrant
        red or orange hue and delicious savory flavor.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's often served at celebrations and gatherings, with variations found
        across different West African countries, each claiming their version is
        the best!
      </p>
      <p>
        The key to a great jollof is the rich tomato-based sauce, slow-cooked
        with aromatic spices, which infuses every grain of rice with incredible
        flavor.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's often accompanied by various proteins like chicken, beef, or fish,
        and sometimes plantains.
      </p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Prepare the Blended Mix:</strong> Blend the fresh tomatoes,
            red bell pepper, and Scotch bonnet peppers (if using) until smooth.
            Set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sauté Aromatics:</strong> Heat vegetable oil in a large pot
            or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté
            until translucent, about 5–7 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cook Tomato Paste:</strong> Add the tomato paste to the pot
            and fry for 5–7 minutes, stirring constantly, until it darkens and
            loses its raw taste. This step is crucial for depth of flavor.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Add Blended Mix:</strong> Pour in the blended tomato-pepper
            mixture. Add bay leaves, curry powder, dried thyme, salt, and black
            pepper. Stir well and bring to a simmer.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Simmer the Sauce:</strong> Reduce heat to low, cover, and
            let the sauce simmer for 15–20 minutes, allowing the flavors to
            meld. Stir occasionally to prevent burning.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Add Rice:</strong> Rinse the rice thoroughly until the water
            runs clear. Add the rinsed rice to the simmering sauce and stir
            gently to combine, ensuring every grain is coated with the sauce.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Add Broth:</strong> Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth.
            Stir once, then cover the pot tightly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cook the Rice:</strong> Reduce heat to very low and cook for
            20–30 minutes, or until the liquid has been absorbed and the rice is
            tender. Do not stir too much during this stage to allow the rice to
            steam properly. If the rice is still hard, you can add a little more
            water or broth and continue cooking.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Rest and Serve:</strong> Once cooked, turn off the heat and
            let the jollof rice sit, covered, for another 5–10 minutes. Fluff
            with a fork before serving. Serve hot with your choice of protein
            and a side of plantains or salad.
