        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Cook Noodles:</strong> Cook the noodles according to package
            directions. Drain and toss with 1 tbsp sesame oil to prevent
            sticking. Set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Prepare Sauce:</strong> In a small bowl, whisk together soy
            sauce, oyster sauce (if using), brown sugar, rice vinegar,
            cornstarch, and water until smooth. Set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong><mark>Cook Chicken:</mark></strong> Heat vegetable oil in a
            large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the sliced chicken
            and stir-fry until cooked through and lightly browned, about 5–7
            minutes. Remove chicken from the skillet and set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Stir-fry Vegetables:</strong> Add the broccoli florets to
            the same skillet and stir-fry for 3–4 minutes until slightly
            tender-crisp. Add the red and green bell peppers, minced garlic, and
            grated ginger. Stir-fry for another 2–3 minutes until vegetables are
            tender-crisp.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Combine Ingredients:</strong> Return the cooked chicken to
            the skillet with the vegetables. Add the cooked noodles.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Add Sauce:</strong> Give the sauce a quick whisk (as
            cornstarch can settle) and pour it over the noodles, chicken, and
            vegetables.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Toss and Serve:</strong> Toss everything together for 1–2
            minutes until the noodles and ingredients are well coated with the
            sauce and heated through.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Garnish:</strong> Remove from heat. Garnish with sliced
            green onions and sesame seeds before serving.
