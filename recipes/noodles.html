            <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breast or thighs, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 head broccoli, cut into small florets</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 green bell pepper, thinly sliced</li>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook Noodles: Cook the noodles according to package directions. Drain and toss with 1 tbsp sesame oil to prevent sticking. Set aside.</li>

            <li>Prepare Sauce: In a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, oyster sauce (if using), brown sugar, rice vinegar, cornstarch, and water until smooth. Set aside.</li>

            <li>Cook Chicken: Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the sliced chicken and stir-fry until cooked through and lightly browned, about 5-7 minutes. Remove chicken from the skillet and set aside.</li>

            <li>Stir-fry Vegetables: Add the broccoli florets to the same skillet and stir-fry for 3-4 minutes until slightly tender-crisp. Add the red and green bell peppers, minced garlic, and grated ginger. Stir-fry for another 2-3 minutes until vegetables are tender-crisp.</li>

            <li>Combine Ingredients: Return the cooked chicken to the skillet with the vegetables. Add the cooked noodles.</li>

            <li>Add Sauce: Give the sauce a quick whisk (as cornstarch can settle) and pour it over the noodles, chicken, and vegetables.</li>

            <li>Toss and Serve: Toss everything together for 1-2 minutes until the noodles and ingredients are well coated with the sauce and heated through.</li>

            <li>Garnish: Remove from heat. Garnish with sliced green onions and sesame seeds before serving.</li>
        </ol>
