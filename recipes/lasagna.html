      <h2>Lasagna</h2>
      <p>
        Lasagna is an iconic Italian dish, beloved for its comforting layers of
        pasta, rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel or ricotta cheese mixture, and
        melted mozzarella.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a culinary masterpiece that embodies warmth and indulgence, making
        it a perfect meal for family dinners or special occasions. While it
        requires a bit of assembly, the effort is well worth it, as each bite
        delivers a harmonious blend of savory, tangy, and cheesy flavors that
        are truly irresistible.

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Prepare Meat Sauce:</strong> Heat olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over
            medium heat. Add ground beef (or sausage) and cook, breaking it
            apart with a spoon, until browned. Drain any excess grease.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sauté Aromatics:</strong> Add chopped onion to the pot and cook until
            softened, about 5 minutes. Add minced garlic and cook for another
            minute until fragrant.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Simmer Sauce:</strong> Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste,
            water (or broth), oregano, basil, and red pepper flakes (if using).
            Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to
            low, cover, and let it cook for at least 30 minutes, or up to an
            hour, stirring occasionally.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Prepare Ricotta Mixture:</strong> In a medium bowl, combine ricotta cheese,
            egg, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, and fresh parsley. Mix well and season
            with a pinch of salt and pepper.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cook Noodles (if not oven-ready):</strong> If using regular lasagna noodles,
            cook them according to package directions until al dente. Drain and
            rinse with cold water to prevent sticking. Lay them flat on
            parchment paper or a clean surface.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Preheat Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Assemble Lasagna:</strong> In a 9x13-inch baking dish, spread a thin layer of meat sauce.
            Add a layer of noodles, followed by 1/3 of the ricotta mixture and 1/3 of the mozzarella.
            Repeat layers (sauce → noodles → ricotta → mozzarella) two more times.
            Top with remaining sauce, mozzarella, and a sprinkle of Parmesan.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Bake:</strong> Cover with foil (tented slightly to avoid cheese sticking) and bake for
            25 minutes. Remove foil and bake for another 15–20 minutes until bubbly and golden.
            Let rest 10–15 minutes before serving.
