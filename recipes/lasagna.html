        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare Meat Sauce: Heat olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add ground beef (or sausage) and cook, breaking it apart with a spoon, until browned. Drain any excess grease.</li>
            <li>Sauté Aromatics: Add chopped onion to the pot and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Simmer Sauce: Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, water (or broth), oregano, basil, and red pepper flakes (if using). Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low, cover, and let it cook for at least 30 minutes, or up to an hour, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Prepare Ricotta Mixture: In a medium bowl, combine ricotta cheese, egg, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, and fresh parsley. Mix well and season with a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Cook Noodles (if not oven-ready): If using regular lasagna noodles, cook them according to package directions until al dente. Drain and rinse with cold water to prevent sticking. Lay them flat on parchment paper or a clean surface.</li>
            <li>Preheat Oven: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        </ol>
